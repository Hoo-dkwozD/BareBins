Program to aid in the development of exploit code. 

It can be used to create a set of python files that can be used to 
build an end-to-end exploit from reconnaissance to action on objective. 
Alternatively, it can be used as a module directly to create exploits. 

It uses a structure similar to Metasploit with more flexibility added to it. 
It comes with only a simple set of pre-written modules, so that it can also
be used in certification tests that do not allow the use of Metasploit.
